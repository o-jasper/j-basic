<p>Most of these files are for getting rid of 'little lackings' in common lisp
 that are not resolved in alexandra. Most of this is _not_ sufficiently 
thought out to be taken too seriously.(though a bunch is tested in src/test) 
Really though, i think more of a standard lib might be advisable..</p>

<p>Somewhat exceptions are parse-number, read-tab-listing and regex-sequence.
</p>

<p>Dependency is <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/">alexandria</a>, except for regex-sequence which depends on
<a href="http://www.cliki.net/REGEX">regex</a></p>
