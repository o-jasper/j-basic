#j-Basic

Most of these files are for getting rid of 'little lackings' in common lisp
 that are not resolved in alexandra. Most of this is _not_ sufficiently 
thought out to be taken too seriously.(though a bunch is tested in src/test) 
Really though, i think more of a standard lib might be advisable..

Somewhat exceptions are parse-number, read-tab-listing and regex-sequence.

Dependency is [alexandria](http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria),
except for regex-sequence which depends on 
[regex](http://www.cliki.net/REGEX).
